# Hi, I'm Aahil (AJ) Jivani!

I'm an MSc student passionate about Financial Engineering, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Data Science. My focus is on building predictive models and algorithmic strategies for financial markets, blending machine learning with quantitative finance. Currently, I'm diving deep into Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto to master DRL for portfolio optimization and trading.

**Interests & Skills**

- **Financial Engineering**
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**
- **Data Science & AI**
- **Calisthenics, bouldering, yoga, and hiking keep me balanced!**

**Currently Learning**

Deepening my understanding of RL through Sutton and Barto, focusing on MDPs, value functions, and policy gradients for DRL.
Experimenting with financial datasets (e.g., yfinance, CKAN API) to apply ML/DRL in real-world contexts.

**Key Projects**

LSTM-Stock-Returns-Predictions: Built an LSTM model with PyTorch to predict stock returns, incorporating log returns, technical indicators (RSI, MACD), and market data (S&P 500, VIX).

Financial-Engineering: Exploring quantitative finance models, with plans to integrate DRL for trading strategies.

bike-share-predictive-modeling: Developed a classification model to predict Toronto Bike Share user types, showcasing ETL and feature engineering.

Multi_Layer_Perceptron_Scratch: Implemented a neural network from scratch using NumPy, mastering backpropagation for non-linear function approximation.

RL Algorithms from Scratch: Computing RL Agents from scratch to get an in-depth understanding of RL algorithms

Dataset-Visualizations: Created EDA visualizations (e.g., pair-plots) for large datasets using Pandas and Seaborn.

**Collaboration & Contact**

Open to Collaborate: Excited to work on financial modeling, DRL, or data science projects!
